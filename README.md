The "super" market scraper ;)
Very much a work in progress


## Dependencies
* Python 3.4
* Beautiful-soup4
* Requests

(i think thats about it)

## A note on virtualenv
So you could just install the dependencies through pip (if you don't knwo what
that is get it on your computer asaaap), but it is recommended to do it
instead through a virtual environment (so it doesn't fuck shit up too much for
OS criticial applications, don't think it'll be to big of a deal on windows
but good practice is good practice)

Great little intro to it all can be found
[here](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/)

## Set up
This set up might end up being entirely different on windows machine so bear
with me

* Make sure you got python 3.4
* **optional** set up virtual environment `virtualenv venv -p python3`
* **optional** activate it (`source venv/bin/activate`)
* install beautiful-soup4 `pip install bs4`
* install Requests `pip install requests`
* Start fucking deving it upppppppp
